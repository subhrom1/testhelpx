# **Issue: Print Settings button does not work**

The Print Settings button does not respond when you choose Printer Manages Color in Adobe Photoshop's Print dialog box.

This issue can occur when you use an older printer driver, or when files have been printed with an older printer driver.

Sometimes, the printer driver's preferences can become damaged. Solution 3 (macOS) and Solution 5 (Windows) remove the driver, which also removes the driver's preferences.
